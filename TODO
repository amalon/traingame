TrackMode
[ ] adjust new nodes until finished initial drag
    [ ] come out from appropriate end of start node
    [ ] rotate new nodes to face one another as a straight
    [ ] rotate new end node for minimum length to start node
[ ] Snap to connection points, merging nodes
[ ] Drag out midpoints before committing with tick button/Enter
[ ] TrackSection selection mode
    [ ] Nearby mouseover selects virtual mid-node
[ ] Selection of subset of multi-track node
[ ] Interface for changing/setting number of tracks

TrackSection
[ ] Extremely short straight not calculated
[ ] Begin merging T2/T3 when directions match and straight wants to be negative
[ ] Add other algorithms to compete with 2 curves + straight
    [ ] Single clothoid
    [ ] Clothoid pair
    [ ] Clothoid pair + fixed curve
[ ] Avoid self-crossing
[ ] Excess end curvature not handled
[x] Multiple tracks in sections and nodes
[ ] Superelevation

Trains
[x] TrainWheelset - a single pair of wheels connected by a fixed axle
[x] TrainBogie - a set of wheelsets and child bogies
[.] TrainCoupling - connects bogies together
[x] TrainUnit - a single unit with couplings, e.g. a locomotive, carriage, or truck
    [ ] Can be stored to a file and duplicated
[ ] TrainTemplate
    A layout of TrainUnits that can be generated
[x] Train - A specific arrangement of train units
    Can be stored to a file, referring to TrainUnits
    [ ] DMU/EMU - a loco at each end (or a loco and cab coach) + carriages in some configuration
    [ ] steam loco + tender + carriages / trucks [+ brake van]
    [ ] multiple locos, e.g. long trains
[ ] TrainPhysics - train physics generalisation (though how do trains then interact with one another?)
    [ ] TrainPhysicsSimple - really simple, just follows track
    [ ] TrainPhysics... - more complicated physics engines
    [ ] TrainPhysicsRigidBody - for more realism
    [ ] TrainPhysicsSoftBody - for crashes
[ ] TrainMode - for putting trains on track
    [ ] select TrainTemplate or start a new train
    [ ] drag TrainUnits onto track
[ ] Enough physics for a loco to pull a train
[ ] Collision detection

General
[ ] Multiple tools GUI
[ ] Delete track segment
[ ] Make use of Gauge data and min/max curves
    Dimentions:
    [x] TrackGauge - distance between rails
        [.] RailProfile - shape of rails - tied to TrackGauge?
    [ ] LoadingGauge - max size of trains
    [ ] StructureGauge - min distance to obstructions at different heights above rails
    [ ] TrackSpacing - min distance to TrackSpacing of an adjacent track (usually of the same TrackSpacing)
    Shapes:
    [ ] TrackSleeperSpec - spacing, type and shape of railway sleepers
        dependent on RailProfile?
        [ ] TrackSleeperType
            [ ] Wooden
            [ ] Concrete
            [ ] Steel
    [ ] TrackBalastSpec - type and profile of track balast
    [x] Track Specification
        TrackGauge - constant throughout, nodes and sections have
        LoadingGauge - may vary, though may be built to min specification
        StructureGauge - may vary, though may be built to min specification
        TrackSpacing - may vary, though may be built to min specification
            could vary along a tracksection?
[x] Fix disappearing view when zooming out
[x] Prettify island a bit
[ ] Convert to 3D
    [ ] Perspective Viewpoint
    [ ] Mouse ray intersection with ground plane
    [ ] 3D track
    [ ] 3D train wheelsets
    [ ] 3D train bogies
    [ ] 3D navigation (rotate / tilt)
    [ ] Rotating wheels
    [ ] Frustum culling
    [ ] More modern use of OpenGL
